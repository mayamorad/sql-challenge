# sql-challenge

_Project Overview_

As a newly hired Data Engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), my first major task is to analyze employee records from the 1980s and 1990s. The only remaining data exists in six CSV fil es, which need to be imported into a SQL database for further analysis. This project involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. 

**Part 1: Data Modeling**
To properly structure the database, I analyzed the CSV files and designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visualizes how the tables are connected.

Key considerations:
- Identified primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships
- Ensured data integrity with appropriate constraints
- Normalized the data to remove redundancy

**Part 2: Data Engineering:** Using the provided 6 CSV files, a table schema was created that included data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints in addition to tables.

**Data Analysis:** The queries.sql code answers the questions prompted.
